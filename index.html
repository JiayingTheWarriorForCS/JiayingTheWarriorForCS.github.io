<p>In this game, you are a dragon warrior who was trapped by evil Dr.Math. 
You have to run away from his jungle and watch out for those moving wall and spike! After each level is finished, you will enter an ice palace, where you have to choose a correct block to stand on and direct you to the correct place. 
If you choose the wrong block, you will die. But how to know which one is the correct one? Dr.Math might leave some hints (some different blocks) on your way. 
In the last level, you have to face Dr.Math's dangerous Math bubbles. 
If you had a math power (number) that is greater than the math power of a Math bubbles, it will become your own power! 
But if not, it will kill you!
Now, just start and enjoy your game!
Space to jump, DownArrow to fly</p>
